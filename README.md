## 📝 Overview  

This project is a **comprehensive data engineering pipeline** built on **Microsoft Azure**. The goal is to **ingest, transform, and visualize data** using cloud-based services such as **Azure Data Factory, Data Lake, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI**.  

The pipeline follows the **Bronze-Silver-Gold** architecture, ensuring data is cleaned, transformed, and optimized for analysis.

## 🔍 **What I'm Working On**  

✅ **Data Ingestion with Azure Data Factory (ADF)** 🏗️  
- Creating **Azure Data Factory** to automate **data movement**  
- Setting up **Linked Services** for **HTTP data sources** and **Azure Data Lake**  
- Building **dynamic pipelines** to process multiple datasets efficiently  

✅ **Data Storage with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)** ☁️  
- Creating **three storage layers**:  
  - **Bronze** (Raw data)  
  - **Silver** (Cleaned and structured data)  
  - **Gold** (Final optimized datasets for analysis)  

✅ **Data Transformation with Azure Databricks** 🔥  
- Using **Apache Spark** for **scalable data processing**  
- Writing **PySpark scripts** to clean, enrich, and transform data  
- Storing transformed data in the **Gold layer**  

✅ **Data Warehousing with Azure Synapse Analytics** 🗄️  
- Creating **Synapse SQL pools** to store **processed data**  
- Designing **tables and views** for efficient querying and reporting  

✅ **Data Visualization with Power BI** 📊  
- Connecting **Synapse Analytics** to **Power BI**  
- Building **interactive dashboards** for data analysis  
- Publishing reports for **stakeholder insights**
